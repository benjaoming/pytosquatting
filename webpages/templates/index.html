        <h1>Pytosquatting</h1>
        <p><strong>Work in progress:</strong> Fixing typosquatting threats in Python Package Index (PyPI).</p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>In June 2016, <a href="http://incolumitas.com/2016/06/08/typosquatting-package-managers/">Typosquatting programming language package managers</a> stated that <code>urllib2</code> had ~4,000 downloads in 2 weeks. The package name <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/urllib2/">is now squatted</a> by us (the good guys). We take these findings seriously.</p>
        <p>On September 14th 2017, a number of in-the-wild malicious packages on PyPI were disclosed by the <a href="http://www.nbu.gov.sk/skcsirt-sa-20170909-pypi/">Slovenian The National Security Authority</a>.</p>
        <h2>Top 20 stdlib mistakes</h2>
        
        <p>
          Blocked stdlib installations since 20170913: <strong>{{ total_unique_ips }}</strong>
        </p>
        
        <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Package</th>
          <th>Average per day</th>
          <th>Total unique hits</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        {% for pkg in top %}
        <tr>
          <td>{{ pkg.package_name }}</td>
          <td>{{ pkg.avg_per_day|floatformat:0 }}</td>
          <td>{{ pkg.unique_count }}</td>
        </tr>
        {% endfor %}
        </tbody>
        </table>
        <h2>How?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Strategy #1:</strong> We are typosquatting a bunch of stuff on PyPI (all available Python 2 and Python 3 standard libraries). So no matter if you use the security hardened Pip installer, we have managed to mitigate the bulk of the immediate problem.</li>
          <li><strong>Strategy #2:</strong> Use a Pip installer that does safety lookups and fails loudly if the attempted package name does not validate. This should be implemented in your automated deployments and test builds!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Aftermath</h2>
        <p>Being total jerks, we have a pingback in the <code>setup.py</code> of all packages involved in Strategy #1, meaning that in some time, we will know the extend of the issue. The callback doesn't involve any stats from your system, just an IP so we can count that a unique system has attempted to install a non-existing package that <em>could</em> have been exploited.</p>
        
        <p>Furthermore, we are calling for analysis of the current PyPI resources to find in-the-wild exploits of typosquatting as the <a href="http://www.nbu.gov.sk/skcsirt-sa-20170909-pypi/">Slovenian The National Security Authority</a> has done. We hope there are none, but the problem has been around for a long time, and our primer didn't get reactions from the PyPI admins.</p>

        <h2>Mockup of Strategy #2</h2>
        <p>Once done, we hope to achieve a better pip installer that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Verifies that you don't install a package with the name of a stdlib</li>
          <li>Asks a webservice if you are installing a typo of a popular package</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <pre>
pip install pipsec
pip install virtualenv-wrapper  # See that it fails
pip install virtualenvwrapper  # This is correct
          </pre>
        </p>
